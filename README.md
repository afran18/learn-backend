# learn-backend
Hi guys, This is my backend learning journey with Node js.
I have always dwelled in frontend and starting today i.e 06 Sept 2024, I am starting to learn to code in Backend.
- Through this journey I plan to start learning from a NodeJS Udemy course thought by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller and will be building projects.
